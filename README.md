A Simple Toolkit for Demonstrating [Graphs]
---

This toolkit would be helpful for those who are solving an 
Graph Theory Problem, especially for OIers

Functions Planned :

- [x] Parse a common adjacent list/matrix

- [x] Complex list/matrix attributes parsing

- [ ] Display the whole / part of the graph (parsed)

- [ ] Script parsing support (js !)

- [ ] Dynamically Editing & demonstrating Graph in GUI

- [ ] Run some simple graph algorithms (step-by-step debug)

- [ ] Graph Exportation (as standard OI or non-standard form)
